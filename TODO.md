## Dependencies
- Authentication framework must be completed before data retrieval components
- Data retrieval components must be completed before dashboard interface
- Real-time data streaming depends on authentication framework
- Advanced options analytics features depend on options data retrieval
- Multi-timeframe analysis depends on historical data retrieval components
- ML prediction models depend on technical indicators and multi-timeframe analysis
- Backtesting framework depends on historical data and strategy components
- User authentication depends on core dashboard functionality
