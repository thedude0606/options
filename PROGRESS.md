# Progress Report

## Completed Features/Tasks

### Documentation and Setup
- Explored Schwab API documentation to understand authentication requirements and available endpoints
- Set up GitHub repository structure with required documentation files
- Created project structure for the dashboard application
- Set up development environment with necessary dependencies

### Authentication Framework
- Implemented authentication framework using Schwab developer credentials
- Created configuration module for storing API keys and secrets
- Implemented token management and refresh functionality
- Added error handling for authentication failures

### Data Retrieval Components
- Implemented historical data retrieval for stocks
- Implemented options chain data retrieval
- Created data manager class to centralize data access
- Added data caching and storage functionality
- Implemented quote retrieval for real-time stock data

### Dashboard Interface
- Created dashboard layout with control panel and visualization areas
- Implemented stock price and volume charts
- Added options chain visualization
- Created interactive components for symbol selection and time period filtering
- Implemented tabbed interface for different data views

### Real-time Data Features
- Implemented real-time data streaming integration
- Created handlers for real-time quote and option updates
- Added real-time updates to charts and tables
- Implemented streaming connection management and monitoring
- Added toggle functionality for real-time updates
- Fixed real-time data flow issues with improved message handling and error reporting
- Added debug mode to help diagnose streaming data issues
- Enhanced message parsing to handle different Schwab API response formats

### Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite for application components
- Implemented mock tests to simulate API responses without requiring authentication
- Tested authentication, data retrieval, and dashboard functionality
- Verified real-time data integration
- All tests passing successfully

## Current Work in Progress
- Finalizing documentation
- Preparing for final GitHub push

## Known Issues and Challenges
- Authentication requires Python 3.11+ due to Schwabdev library requirements
- Real authentication requires browser interaction for OAuth flow
- Mock tests are used for CI/CD environments where authentication isn't possible
- ~~Data doesn't appear in dashboard despite successful authentication~~ (Fixed)

## Next Steps
- Add additional data filtering options
- Implement data export functionality
- Add user preferences and settings
- Optimize performance for large datasets
