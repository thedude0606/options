# Progress Report

## Completed Features/Tasks

### API Integration Fixes
- Fixed streaming method parameter issues by using 'symbol_list' instead of 'symbols' for level_one_equities and level_one_options methods
- Added handler registration fallback to use on_message if add_handler is not available
- Implemented missing DataManager methods (get_historical_data and get_options_chain) to maintain dashboard compatibility
- Enhanced error handling for streaming data connections
- Improved message parsing to handle different Schwab API response formats

### Documentation and Setup
- Explored Schwab API documentation to understand authentication requirements and available endpoints
- Set up GitHub repository structure with required documentation files
- Created project structure for the dashboard application
- Set up development environment with necessary dependencies
- Added comprehensive documentation for project components and architecture decisions

### Authentication Framework
- Implemented authentication framework using Schwab developer credentials
- Created configuration module for storing API keys and secrets
- Implemented token management and refresh functionality
- Added error handling for authentication failures
- Verified compatibility with Schwab OAuth flow requirements

### Data Retrieval Components
- Implemented historical data retrieval for stocks
- Implemented options chain data retrieval
- Created data manager class to centralize data access
- Added data caching and storage functionality
- Implemented quote retrieval for real-time stock data
- Optimized data retrieval for performance

### Dashboard Interface
- Created dashboard layout with control panel and visualization areas
- Implemented stock price and volume charts
- Added options chain visualization
- Created interactive components for symbol selection and time period filtering
- Implemented tabbed interface for different data views
- Fixed Dash compatibility issues (replaced run_server with app.run_server)

### Real-time Data Features
- Implemented real-time data streaming integration
- Created handlers for real-time quote and option updates
- Added real-time updates to charts and tables
- Implemented streaming connection management and monitoring
- Added toggle functionality for real-time updates
- Fixed real-time data flow issues with improved message handling and error reporting
- Added debug mode to help diagnose streaming data issues
- Enhanced message parsing to handle different Schwab API response formats
- Fixed duplicate callback outputs in dashboard components
- Resolved streamer singleton issues to prevent multiple connection conflicts
- Enhanced StreamerSingleton class with better thread management and connection handling
- Improved RealTimeDataStreamer with better initialization tracking and error handling

### Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite for application components
- Implemented mock tests to simulate API responses without requiring authentication
- Tested authentication, data retrieval, and dashboard functionality
- Verified real-time data integration
- All tests passing successfully
- Added error handling tests to verify system resilience

## Current Work in Progress
- Finalizing documentation for future development
- Preparing for final GitHub push
- Implementing advanced options analytics features
- Enhancing error handling for different API response types
- Optimizing performance for large datasets

## Known Issues and Challenges
- Authentication requires Python 3.11+ due to Schwabdev library requirements
- Real authentication requires browser interaction for OAuth flow
- Mock tests are used for CI/CD environments where authentication isn't possible
- Occasional streaming data disconnections requiring reconnection logic (improved but still occurs)
- Limited error handling for certain edge cases in API responses

## Next Steps
- Add additional data filtering options
- Implement data export functionality
- Add user preferences and settings
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Implement advanced options analytics features (Greeks visualization, implied volatility surface)
- Add multi-timeframe analysis capabilities (15-min, 1-hour, daily)
- Integrate technical indicators including Fair Value Gap analysis
- Develop hybrid ML models for options trading predictions
- Implement dynamic risk management features
- Add comprehensive backtesting capabilities
- Enhance documentation with detailed API usage examples
- Implement user authentication for multi-user support
